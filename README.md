3d Dungeon Crawler rouge like game

Uses Unity and some assets

A 3d dungeon crawler game with procedurally generated worlds.

Around 70% completed, need additions of enemies and loot. Most of the assets and base coding is done, needs a couple bug fixes.


The main focus is physics based fun, all objects can be manipulated by the player and thrown to damage enemies. 

The folders are quite unorganised but all the scripting is done in assets/scripts, all above ground generation is done in the terraingenerator folder, all below ground is done in the ProcGen and Tomb Generator folder


Uses an algorithm designed by me that uses perlin noise to generate terrain over 1 square km without the need for loading screens, without any lag - folder TerrainGenerator and all other folders

Uses an algorithm designed by Jasatron to generate dungeons beneath ground seamlessly - folder ProcGen, Tomb Generation
